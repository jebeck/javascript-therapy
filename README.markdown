## Present and/or Develop

After downloading this repo, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (Or `npm install` if you're about that life. We don't judge. Much.)

Next, run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

To start up the local node server, run `npm start`.

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you are ready to freakin' roll.

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`.

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`.
